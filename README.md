# Generative Art NFTs

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a pipeline for generating artistic style transfers and automating NFT minting process using the Crossmint and Pinata. The project aims to explore the intersection of AI-generated art and blockchain technology, providing a streamlined process for artists and creators to mint their artworks as NFTs on various blockchain platforms.

## Features
- **Style Transfer**: Utilize StyleGAN3 models with the neural style transfer techniques to apply artistic styles to digital images.
- **NFT Minting**: Integrate with Crossmint to mint the generated images as NFTs directly.
## Training Parameters and Resources
- Batch Size: 32
- Kimg: 500
- Mirror: 1
- Snap: 25
- GPU: NVIDIA L4
- Gamma: 6.6
## Model Evaluation
The table presents the Kernel Inception Distance (KID) values of a generative model at various training checkpoints labeled as KIMGs. These checkpoints, recorded at 100, 200, 300, 420, and 500 kimg generations, display a steady decrease in KID values, indicating an improvement in the image quality generated by the model.

## Results

Below are some examples of the artistic style transfers applied using StyleGAN3. These examples demonstrate the potential of the project for creators interested in AI-generated art and blockchain technology.

Prompt: "A close-up portrait of a Scottish Fold cat with an expressive face and folded ears prominently displayed. The cat has a soft, silver-blue coat and deep, thoughtful eyes. The background is a simple, muted color to keep the focus on the intricate details of the catâ€™s fur and unique features."
